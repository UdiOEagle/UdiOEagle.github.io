This is an example blog post. You can create new posts by adding files to the `_posts` directory.

## Getting Started

To create a new post:

1. Create a new file in `_posts/` with the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
2. Add front matter (the content between `---` marks)
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. Commit and push to GitHub

Your post will automatically appear on your site!
